# Grade Prediction
The goal of this project is to use two different approaches (one a random forest classifier and one and approach of your choice) to predict students’ final grade in an online course.

The experiments conducted revealed that the performance of SVM used in the prediction of student’s Performance appears to perform well. Basically, all prediction models were discussed in terms of accuracy and confusion matrix, and it has been proven that SVM outperforms Random Forest in case of predicting students’ results. SVM obtained 91 percent accuracy which is higher than Random Forest accuracy of 77 percent.
